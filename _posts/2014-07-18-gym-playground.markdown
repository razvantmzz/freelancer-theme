    details: An avarage size gym can have over 100 climbing routes, 6 or more difficulty grades and locations. Finding a route can prove difficult, so I wanted to solve this problem. The home screen covers 2 main disciplines :&nbsp Lead Routes and Boulder Problems, ordered by difficulty or location. The preview picture shows a hold from the route and the border matches that hold color to easily find all the information needed. The user can mark them as Sent or tap the heart to like the route.
  - title: Event details
