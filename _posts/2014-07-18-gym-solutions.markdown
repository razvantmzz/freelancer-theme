intro: I am the sole Developer of Gym Solutions which is still in development and planning to officially launch in early 2021. For now a beta version is released in 2 climbing gyms. This is my first real life application fully designed and owned by me. Gym solution offers an easy way for climbers to keep track of their projects, sent routes and compete against each other in their local gym. For gym owners offers a fast way of managing competitions with real time ranking, routes updates and different stages management. Also it offers a wide range of customizable features to make every whitelabel look and feel like their home gym.
my-role: Sole Developer from new project to initial release. Design, App and Backend done by myself.
tech-talk:
  - Gym solution was developed using Flutter SDK for the mobile app and Django for backend. The application uses a few Google Cloud services such as Firebase to provide cloud storage and push notifications. </br> The design was created using Figma and is fully customizable, allowing a fast and easy rebranding. 
sections:

    details: The topo covers Lead Routes, Boulder Problems and customised challenges. The user can group them after grade or location. Tapping on a route will navigate them to a route details screen, allowing them to see an image of the route, details about the setter and who has done it. Here they can mark a route based on their performance:&nbsp Flash, 2nd go and done. Marking a route as done will change the users global ranking points.
  - title: Gym ranking section

    details:  We offer a gym ranking covering all users. Here you can see the performance of every user filtered by category or gender. Also you can see the ranking for current month, past months or since the start. The ranking is computed based on the numbers of attempts each user made on each route, the first time. Sending a route the second time will not change the ranking.
